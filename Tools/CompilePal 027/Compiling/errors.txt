Remember to delete the entire entity, and only that one, or your map may get broken.

<div class="error_box"><h4>Error trying to allocate [sub:1] bytes</h4><p><strong>Description:</strong><br />Vrad.exe did not have enough memory to finish it's task. There are two causes: 1) You are running low on memory (ram + pagefile). 2) Vrad.exe is chocking on some very complicated bit of your map, causing it to ask a lot of memory which doesn't exist (like infinite sizes).<br /><br /><strong>Solution:</strong><br />If you are running low on free memory (ctr+alt+del to see that) try increasing the pagefile if you aren't letting Windows take care of it. If not, use cordon tools to isolate the problemarea in your map (might be a broken brush, or simply too complex geometry) and see what you can do to fix it.<br /><u>Dan Prati</u> informed me that is mostly a problem with very large, open maps, or particularly detailed ones (or as part of an engine limitation to the total amount of lightmaps).<br /><br />Reducing the lightmap resolution on larger surfaces, or particularly complex objects, can fix this problem. If this is not acceptable, or does not fix the error, reducing lightmap resolution across the entire map may be necessary. This provides a solution when there is no single map element that is causing the error, and simply deleting map objects won't fix the problem.<br /><br /><strong>See also:</strong><br /><a href="javascript:showerror(148)">Reference: Finding the unfindable</a></p><p><br /><span class="e_type e_lvl4">This error will cause your map to fail compiling correctly</span></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href="forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=0">Anonymous</a></h5></div>

Allthough easier said than done, you must try to find the overlay in Hammer (where you can only guess where your faces are cut) so its best to check big (stretched) overlays first, and also make sure you have no world brushes cutting each other up near these overlays (eg. near stairs, or when you use a small lightmap scale). The use of func_detail will stop that.<br />If you have an overlay that is applied to a very large brush, try cutting up the offending brush so it is not as large.

I guess it can also be a wanted situation, in which cause this 'error' can be ignored.<br /><br /><strong>Solution:</strong><br />The usual cause i can think of is the accidental non-deletion of displacements along the sides of brushes. Eg, if you have two brushes next to each other, and their tops displaced, and you accidentally also displaced the vertical brushsides between these two, you get a T-shaped intersection of three.<br /><img src="images/errorpage/displ.png" class="errorpageImage" alt="image" /><br />image: purple: side that should've been destroyed, red: the edge.<br /><br />This is no real error, but it could be the cause of lighting anomalies.

3|make_triangles\:calc_triangle_representation\:\s+Cannot\s+convert
<div class="error_box"><h4>make_triangles:calc_triangle_representation: Cannot convert</h4><p><strong>Description:</strong><br />Usually preceded by some coordinates, the best explanation I can give at the moment is that this is caused by certain models (a b0rked subpart). In particular the &quot;/wasteland/InteriorFence002d.mdl&quot;-model. I've also heard small panes of glass and some other (even self-made) models can cause this error to occur, as do some freaky regular brushes. This error can also be caused by bad displacements.<br />If it is displacements they may fail to collide with vehicles and physics objects on the triangles that are causing a problem.  Parts of the displacement may still work others may not.   <br /><br /><strong>Solution:</strong><br />You can look for ages to find the model causing the problem, after hiding all your models first and see if that is causing your problem. Once found, you can decide to reconstruct that model, there doesn't seem to be a real error in the model itself though. In other words, leave it be, it won't hurt you. Unless you bite first! It may be the case that the game will not load the map because of this error. It would present you with a pup-up with the beloved memory error.<br />The displacement problem as of right now has only 1 solution and it is to delete the displacement. If its a brush, find it with Cordon Tools and delete it. </p><p><br /><span class="e_type e_lvl3">The affected object may not work and/or cause general errors</span></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href="forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4214">jmplayer</a></h5></div>

Now, look round the map see if nodraw is anywhere you wanted a real texture. If found open the material browser and find and replace the nodraw texture with any other texture. If there\'s no vibisible displacement faces with nodraw you\'ll probably want to destroy them. Open the material browser, check &quot;Only show used textures&quot;, select NoDraw and press &quot;Mark&quot;.

In other words, if you can draw a straight line through your brush that enters and exits the brush twice, it\'s illegal.<br /><br />The fix is to find the offending brush, and use <a href=\"http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hammer_Vertex_Tool\">vertex-manipulation</a> to move its vertices so its convex again. Or simply delete and recreate the brush.<br /><br />Another way to create an invalid brush is by making two faces share the same plane. No two faces can have an angle between them of 180 degrees. The solution is to use vertex-manipulation to fix the brush.<br /><br />The last way to create invalid solids is by twisting a face. Faces in BSP have to be flat, if they are not, they are invalid. If you do not see whats wrong in the example below, make a cube in Hammer, and go into vertex-manipulation, and move one of the vertices (select one in 3d view) outwards. You will create atleast one twisted face. The solution, again, is the same as the most obvious cause: vertex-manipulation<br /><img src=\"images/errorpage/concave.png\" class=\"errorpageImage\" alt=\"image\" /><br />This solid is concave at the top-left See how a line can be drawn through this solid, which enters and exists twice (blue dots) Fix this by either move this vertex to either of it\'s neightbouring vertices to combine both concave planes, or by moving the vertex outwards so the planes it defines are convex (pointy) again. <br /><img src=\"images/errorpage/coplanar.png\" class=\"errorpageImage\" alt=\"image\" /><br />This solid is coplanar with it\'s two bottom faces See how both faces are in the same line (plane)? Fix this by either destroying on of the planes by moving the vertex on one of its neighbouring vertices, or by moving it outwards. Moving it inwards will make the brush concave!<br /><img src=\"images/errorpage/twisted.png\" class=\"errorpageImage\" alt=\"image\" /><br />The blue marked face is twisted. Fix this by selecting two vertices and press ctrl+f to split the twisted face. Make sure you don\'t select the wrong ones, you could make the brush concave!<br /><br />Yes, the usual cause is either vertex-manipulation or usage of complicated brush-shapes (e.g. rotated cylinders, torusses). Usually, Hammers problem checker (alt+p) finds these errors. Occasionally it doesn\'t, and vbsp.exe or even vrad.exe will report the errors instead.<br /><br />BSP doesn\'t really support complicated brushwork, you\'ll often find yourself splitting brushes or use models or displacements to create the shapes you need.

errors[147]="<div class=\"error_box\"><h4>Leaks</h4><p>With leaks vbsp.exe wont be able to divide your level into visleafs, so it wont create a portal file. Therefore, you can\'t use vvis or Glview. Leaks also make vbsp.exe not know which faces it can delete, making your map only laggier and bigger, and vrad.exe will not be able to light your map as good as without leaks.<br /><br />In short: Leaks give you trouble. Leaks are holes in you map. Since the compilers will try to find out what the inside is of your level (so they dont have to create the outside of your level) they will not be able to do that if the inside of your level is in contact with the outside.<br />Think of your map as a spaceship: only when it\'s hull is completely air-tight, people (all the entities) will be able to live inside. If there\'s a hole leaking into space (the void) everybody will die. On our spaceship that is. Not in this game. And just like in a spaceship, entities (humans) can\'t plug holes in the hull. (displacements can\'t either btw) Vbsp.exe simply takes all entities and see if it can draw a line from the entity into the void. If it can draw such a line, your map has a leak somewhere. This also means that if your map doesn\'t have a single entity, no leakchecking can be done. However, in that case vbsp.exe will still report a leak!<br /><br /><strong>How to find leaks?</strong><br />First of all, vbsp.exe will write an error in the compile log. The leak error doesn\'t stand out, but if you look carefull you can see something like:<br /></p><div class=\"postCode\"><pre>**** leaked ****<br />Entity info_player_deathmatch (22.94 -64.44 17.00) leaked!<br /></pre></div><p><br />It will report an entity (e.g. info_player_deathmatch) and some coordinates.  Now, when you go to [map-&gt;load pointfile] and load your pointfile (usually Hammer can find it, if not, youll have to search manually for it (it\'s called &quot;mapname.lin&quot;). If it doesn\'t exist, make sure your map has entities in it) a red line will appear, starting at the stated entity (at the stated coordinates), and ending outside your level in the void. If you just follow that line, it will eventually pass through your leak.<br /><br />If you cant find the entity the line starts, go to &quot;tools-&gt; go to coordinates&quot; and fill in the coordinates mentioned in the log. Remember entities and displacements can\'t block leaks, therefore its easiest to hide all entities and displacements so you can spot the leak easier (you might have turned a wall into an entity which was supposed to seal your level for instance). In space you can\'t seal holes in a spaceship with humans, in maps you can\'t seal holes with entities. Simple as that. Better use vis-groups to hide the entities. Simply uncheck &quot;auto&quot; in the visgroup manager (to the right in Hammer), and all entities will be gone untill you check the box again. This is great for searching for leaks.  Removing the mentioned entity will only help if the entity itself is outside the level, but the level itself is sealed (e.g. when a person from our sealed spaceship is going for a space-walk).<br /><br />Also, leaks may be caused by invalid use of areaportal(window)s (in our spaceship, areaportal(window)s are airlocks). If you\'ve fixed the leak, there may still be another one. Therefore, unload the pointfile (under &quot;menu&quot; )and recompile. If there\'s another leak, simply load the pointfile again. Keep doing that untill there are no more leaks.<br />Note that no pointfile can be made if your level has no entities, but your map will still leak. You need atleast one entity in your map to compile it succesfully.<br /><br /><strong>See also:</strong><br /><a href=\"tutorials/2248\">Leaks explained</a><br /><a href=\"tutorials/12576\">Advanced leaks guide</a></p><p></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href=\"forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=0\">Anonymous</a></h5></div>";
errors[148]="<div class=\"error_box\"><h4>Finding the unfindable</h4><p>It\'s actually very simple. Use visgroups or cordon-tools in Hammer to hide parts of your level when you compile. If the map compiles without you getting your error, you know the error is in the part you didn\'t hide, and vice-versa. With this knowledge, you can hide half of that half and compile again, again and so forth untill you got your error.<br /><br />Instead of using geometric halves, you may also try to hide e.g. all your displacement, or all your point-based entities. As the part that creates your errors gets smaller and smaller, you may try to delete/hide certain suspicious entities/brushes (like vertex-manipulated entities, or complicated input/output systems) to see if that fixes the error.<br /><br />There are some things you have to remember though: Some errors are caused by having to much of something. If you compile your map in parts none of the parts will have the error, but the error will still exist. Also, some errors are not caused by specific brushes but by entire area\'s. Any changes to these area\'s by cordoning or visgroups may fix the error, but again the error still exists. Lastly, in some occasions compiling a part of your level may cause other problems you didn\'t have before.<br /><br /><strong>Visgroups</strong><br />Hiding certain brushes or entity-groups can be done very easily using the visgroups (the window on the middle-right). A visgroup is a group of brushes which you can hide or show with one click. Just uncheck the tickbox left of any group to hide everything part of this group (and check it to make them visible again). Adding visgroups can be done by selecting some stuff you want to hide, and go to &quot;view-&gt;hide selected items&quot;. a new, unchecked visgroup will appear in the visgroup window with the brushes you just deleted. You may edit visgroups directly in the visgroup tool by clicking on their name.<br /><br /><strong>Cordon-tools</strong><br />The cordon tools work like a construction-box. Click on the black&amp;yellow striped button to edit cordon bounds. the &quot;edit cordon bounds&quot;-button gives you a red box to (like a brush) you can place in your level and resize. The button left to this one enables and disables the cordon tools. Only stuff inside this box gets compiled, so its great for fast preview-compiling and error-finding. They also make the 2d screens in hammer less cluttered. Be sure to disable the cordon tools once you dont need them, because they act like a giant sky-box. (thus cause lag)  Whatever you do, be sure an info_player_start (or other entity) is available in the part you are going to compile, or else the map would not compile properly (errors like leaks will appear)  If you require more information, see this (more explaining plus visually more attractive) <a href=\"tutorials/2118\">tutorial</a>.</p><p></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href=\"forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=0\">Anonymous</a></h5></div>";
errors[149]="<div class=\"error_box\"><h4>All about the compile process</h4><p>Because of the way the source-engine works, all your maps need to be compiled: Translated from a format your editor (e.g. Hammer, Quark) can understand to one the source-engine can understand.  Currently, this takes three programs:<br /></p><ul class=\"errlist\"><li>Vbsp.exe: transforms your map to a completely playable map. Also outputs a portalfile<br /></li><li>Vvis.exe: uses the portalfile created by VBSP to calculate which parts of your level need to be drawn from where.<br /></li><li>Vrad.exe: lights your map.</li></li></ul><p><br />Seeing what each program does allows you to predict what happens when you do not run each program:<br /></p><ul class=\"errlist\"><li>Not running Vbsp.exe results in an error (no playable map will be made, nor will vvis or vrad be able to work). If a previous successfully compiled map isn\'t removed, the rest of the tools will work on an older version of the map!<br /></li><li>Not running Vvis.exe results in ingame lag, because the entire level will be drawn. The fast-vis option allows you to do a semi-good job, but it\'s crappy and error-prone. Water will not work without vvis.<br /></li><li>Not running Vrad.exe results in your map not being lit, which causes source to go in fullbright mode so you will still see something ingame. Again, the fast options is faster but does a crappier job.</li></li></ul><p><br />It is advisable to not run any tools on fast option for final compiles, so your level looks and runs the best it can. If vvis or VRAD take too long, you need to optimize your map, see <a href=\"http://www.student.ru.nl/rvanhoorn/Optimization.php\">this tutorial</a>.<br />All three programs have some extra options do do extra nifty stuff. More on that <a href=\"tutorials/1811\">here</a>. The only option you may need to know, is the &quot;only entities&quot; option for VBSP. This allows you to change entity properties (e.g. targetnames, targets etc) without the need to recompile the entire map. This only works if you already have a compiled map ready, and for some reason you can\'t publish your map when using this option to make &quot;last-minute-repairs&quot;. It\'s just for testing-purposes. There\'s also <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/cofrdrbob/entspy.html\">entspy</a>, which can do the same, only without errors.<br /><br /><strong>Batch compiling</strong><br />Because compiling is done by external tools (not by Hammer) you can also use batch-files to compile your map. they also allow you to use the other extra options for the tools.<br />Learn more about it here: <a href=\"tutorials/1811\">batch tutorial</a>. <br /><br />Or simply use Nem\'s batch compiler: <a href=\"http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=3\">found here</a><br /><br /><strong>Expert compiling</strong><br />Expert compiling combines the ease of the normal Hammer compile mode with the versatilability of batch-scripts.

The creation of these visleafs can be very troublesome, so it\'s very handy to have a tool like this to see where the process has gone wrong.<br /><br /><strong>Part of the functionality is obsolete since Hammer can load the portalfile (view-&gt;load portalfile) to view visleafs.</strong><br /><br /><strong>How to run glview</strong><br />In <a href=\"tutorials/1836\">expert compile mode</a> make a new configuration, name it glview (this allows you to use it for all your maps), and create the following commands: <br /></p><div class=\"postCode\"><pre>   Executable      parameters:<br />   $bsp_exe        -glview $path\\$file<br />   glview*         -portal $path\\$file.gl</pre></div><p><br /><br /><i>*the command for glview isn\\\'t known by hammer, so youll have to find it yourself: press &quot;executable&quot;, and browse to glview.exe (in the sourcesdk\\bin directory)</i><br />If your map is in a path with a dot in it (for instance, in your Steam name) you need to copy both the gl-file and the portalfile to another path without a dot, or else glview wont work. For instance, by adding these commands between $bsp_exe and glview.exe:<br /></p><div class=\"postCode\"><pre>   Command:        parameters:<br />   $bsp_exe        -glview $path\\$file<br />   copy file       $path\\$file.gl C:\\temp\\<br />   copy file       $path\\$file.prt C:\\temp\\<br />   glview          -portal C:\\temp\\$file.gl</pre></div><p><br /><i>Where c:\\temp is the path you want to use to place the files</i><br />make sure both commands are set to run, and press &quot;GO!&quot;<br />Once vbsp.exe has made a gl-file (it wont do that if your map has errors like <a href=\"javascript:showerror(147)\">leaks</a>) glview will start and a 3d screen will appear of your level. you can fly around using the wasd-keys, and toggle portals with the 1 and 2 keys.</p><p></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href=\"forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=0\">Anonymous</a></h5></div>";

It is likely that you either need to func_detail a lot of brushes in that area, or that you have an invalid brush somewhere (Alt-p in hammer to check for them).

Displacements aren\'t supposed to be entities. (they don\'t need to be func_detail, vvis.exe ignores them anyway). Displacements can\'t move around. Period. Forget about parenting them.<br /><br /><strong>Solution:</strong><br />Find your displacement and de-entify it. The easiest method to find it in a big map is to select all displacements at once (select the &quot;displacements&quot; visgroup (in the visgroup-window to the right in Hammer), then press &quot;mark&quot;) in the ignore group mode (button &quot;IG&quot;). Now tie all of the displacements to an entity, and &quot;to world&quot; them again right after that while they are still selected.</p><p><br /><span class=\"e_type e_lvl5\">This error will cause your map to fail compiling completely</span></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href=\"forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375\">Anonymous</a></h5></div>";
